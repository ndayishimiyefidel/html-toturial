                It is commonly assumed and accepted that hackers help to build security whereas crackers aim to break
                security. There is a major difference between how the two work although they both engage in hacking of
                some sort. Hackers usually have an advanced level knowledge regarding computer security and possess all
                the technical knowledge required as well but are not necessarily skilful as hackers. Few of them are
                skilled enough to develop their own software and tools. Hackers aim to counter attack threats posed by
                crackers to the computer systems as well as internet security across networks.
